## Goal of the Risk Tool: <a name = "Goal"></a>
Goal of the tool is to display risk and allow users to double click on visually evaluating risk.

## üíΩ Setup: <a name = "setup"></a>
If you would like to install and use this tool on your own machine make sure you have `pipenv` installed. If you need to install follow [these simple instructions](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv#installation).

### Downloading The Prerequisites

The packages needed to run this tool: `pipenv`, `homebrew`, `python3`, `pandas`, and `numpy`.

The packages `pandas` and `numpy` will need to be installed in order for these repositories to work. If you do not have them installed, run these commands in your terminal:

```
pipenv install pandas
```

```
pipenv install numpy
```


### Cloning The Repo

Clone the MCD Risk Model Repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/madison1111/mcd_risk_model.git
```

Then cd into the directory:

```
cd mcd_risk_model
```

### Loading the Models
To reproduce results run the following commands:

```
python3 mcd_risk_model_1.py
```

```
python3 mcd_risk_model_2.py
```

### For Analysis
Start your Jupyter notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```

If your browser doesn't automatically open, then go to:

```
http://localhost:8888
```

## üéõ Running the Models
Notebooks can be found in the `notebooks` folder

### MCD Risk Model 1:

```
mcd_risk_model_1.py
```

### Step 1:
Before doing anything else this script imports the various dependencies that allow for the script to be run in python as well as creates a class for the initial variables that we need

```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import time
```

And create the class:


```
class mcd_model_1:
    def __init__(self, start, end):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end
```

After, we look to call our data and will make two separate methods within our mcd_model_1 class, one for a single collateral type, and one for multiple collateral types

Data is encapsulated in Risk RESTful API

## Historical Data
Collect trading history across all exchanges

### Read in data
Data methodology is outlined in Risk API github repo

### Historical exchange data

There is no ‚Äòmaster exchange‚Äô to pull from so we pull from several BTI verified exchanges, as price is determined by supply and demand and wash trading is a real problem among cryptocurrency exchanges

We pull data from 5 major exchanges: `Coinbase`, `Bitfinex`, `Poloniex`, `another`, and `another` to calculate an aggregate price index.

For example we can inspect the last 4 rows of the dataframe using the `tail()` method

should illustrate what the expected environment would look like once the solution is implemented.
- REALITY: This section is used to describe the current or ‚Äúas is‚Äù state of the process or product. 
- CONSEQUENCES: This section is used to describe the impacts on the business if the problem is not fixed or improved upon.
This includes costs associated with loss of money, time, productivity, competitive advantage, and so forth.

Following this format will result in a workable document that can be used to understand the problem and elicit
requirements that will lead to a winning solution. 

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

Define single collateral type:

```
def get_single_collateral(self, symbol):
        #dates
        start = self.start 
        end = self.end 
        
        prices = ETH['Close']
        returns = prices.pct_change()
        
        self.returns = returns
        self.prices = prices
```

Define multiple collateral types:

```
def get_multiple_collateral(self, symbols, weights):
        start = self.start
        end = self.end
        
        #Get exchange price data
        df = ETH['Close']
       
        #percent Change
        returns = df.pct_change()
        returns += 1
        
        #define allocation of each asset 
        portfolio_value = returns * weights
        portfolio_value['Portfolio Value'] = portfolio_value.sum(axis=1)
        
        #Portfolio prices
        prices = portfolio_value['Portfolio Value']
        
        #portfolio returns 
        returns = portfolio_value['Portfolio Value'].pct_change()
        returns = returns.replace([np.inf, -np.inf], np.nan)
                
        self.returns = returns
        self.prices = prices

```

Checking out momentum:

```
#Moving averages are a great way to determine the momentum of the cryptocurrency
ma_days = [10,20,50]
for ma in ma_days:
    column_name = "MA %s days" %(str(ma))
    ETH[column_name] = ETH['Adj Close'].rolling(window=ma,center=False).mean()
ETH[['Adj Close','MA 10 days','MA 20 days','MA 50 days']].plot(legend=True)

```

### Moving average representation:



Moving average representation expresses any time series Ytas:

ETH output:

Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been 
completed, and understood, it becomes easier to provide a solution for solving the problem.
